ðŸ’» I develop websites, blogs and web applications since 2014. Most of the time, I work with the React Ecosystem and its main frameworks (Next, Gatsby, CRA.. ), sometimes I code backend using Node with Typescript.

ðŸ“– Iâ€™m currently learning and improving my skills with Web Performance, Clean Code, and the new browser features.

ðŸ“œ My undergraduate thesis was about the impact of Web Performance on User Experience.
