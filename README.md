💻 I develop websites, blogs and web applications. Most of the time, I work with the React Ecosystem and its main frameworks (Next, Gatsby, CRA.. ), sometimes I code some server side using Typescript and Node.

📖 I’m currently learning and improving my skills with Clean Code, Clean Architecture and the new browser features.

🎓 I'm also finishing my degree in computer science at the Federal University of Uberlândia.

📜 My undergraduate thesis will be about PWAs and MicroFrontEnds.
